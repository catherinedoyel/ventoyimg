Images with Ventoy & and EFI folder.

Do not rely these releases yet. Any files you download labeled as build are not widely tested.
The process is very automated but still relies on a commit to create new releases.

# Using images (preferred solution)
If you want to try the .img.zip files I would recommend [balenaEtcher for Windows, Mac & Linux](https://etcher.balena.io/), [Chromebook Recovery Utility for Windows, Mac, Linux & **ChromeOS**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm), or [EtchDroid for Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.depau.etchdroid)  
- when using EtchDroid you will first need to unzip and get the img file out of the zip folder. You may run into similar issue on a Chromebook.
As a part of using the .img.zip files I would recommend the 256MB one first to ensure that the process works correctly. Then get a bigger size once you know it works.

# Using EFI folder
If you cannot run software like this on your devices do not lose hope. Anything that can copy files out of a zip folder and put it on a fat32 formatted usb stick can work with an exception. The resulting flash drive will only work on 64 bit UEFI computers such as laptops made after Windows 8 (2012). Perhaps you can use a kiosk style computer like in a library or computer lab, with permission of course.
